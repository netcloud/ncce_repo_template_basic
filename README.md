## <a name="info"></a> General information

This repository is managed by the PCS team. Main contributors are [Timo Haldi](mailto:thaldi@netcloud.ch) and [Ardin Ibraimi](mailto:ibraimi@netcloud.ch)


The purpose of this repository is ...

## <a name="development"></a> Development

### Daily work instructions

When you start working you should always remember the following commands:

```shell
# get into pipenv shell to have the pre-commit active
pipenv shell

# pull latest code changes from the repo
git pull

# install latest dependencies
pipenv install

# activate the pre-commit hook (the first time and whenever changes to it are applied)
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-push
```
With those commands you ensure that your code is properly checked before you commit it and share it with the whole team and you ensure that you're always working on the latest code version. The last two commands are commands required when version updates to the Pipfile or adjustments to the pre-commits hooks get applied.

## <a name="semantic-commit-workflow"></a> Semantic Commit Workflow
Our MCF Enterprise customers want to stay informed about new features introduced in quarterly foundation updates.
Commit messages follow the **Angular Commit Message Conventions** to standardize and automate versioning. These conventions are enforced by pre-commit hooks for validation.

The automation relies on **semantic-release**, which:

1. Analyzes commit messages.
2. Determines the next semantic version (major, minor, patch).
3. Generates the changelog.
4. Tags the version in the repository automatically.

To achieve this, the following workflow is used:

- **Bug Fix (Patch Release):**
  `git commit -m "fix(NCPCS-XXX): resolve login token issue"`

- **New Feature (Minor Release):**
  `git commit -m "feat(NCPCS-XYZ): add dark mode"`

- **Breaking Change (Major Release):**
  For a breaking change provide to your normal commit message also a footer message containing the `BREAKING CHANGE` token:
  ```
    git commit -m "feat(NCPCS-YYY): add new interface" -m "BREAKING CHANGE: Introduce new interface"
  ```

A changelog (release log) is automatically generated for every update.

### Commit and Branch Naming Conventions

#### Commit Messages

Follow the **Angular Commit Message Conventions**. Example format:
```shell
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

- **Type:**
  - `BREAKING CHANGE` --> Correlates with MAJOR Release, must be part of the commit message footer
  - `feat` --> A new feature. Correlates with MINOR Release
  - `fix` --> A bug fix. Correlates with PATCH Release
  - `chore` --> updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change
  - `docs` --> Documentation only changes
  - `perf` --> A code change that improves performance, etc.
- **Scope:** The area of the code being changed (optional).
- **Description:** A short, imperative description of the change.


#### Branch Naming

Branch names should be descriptive and include Jira ticket IDs. Example formats:

- `feature/NCPCS-1234-add-login`
- `bugfix/NCPCS-5678-fix-authentication-error`
- `hotfix/NCPCS-5678-patch-critical-vulnerability`

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks validate commit messages and branch names. Ensure you run `pre-commit install` to activate hooks for:

- **Commit message validation** (commitizen hook in `commit-msg` stage).
- **Branch name validation** (commitizen-branch hook in `push` stage).
